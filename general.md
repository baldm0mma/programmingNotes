@kevin: what is the 'prerelease' metadate for? When have we used it in the past, how are we using it now?
@self: what is the product 'grafana-pro'? How does it differ from 'grafana-entreprise'?
@kevin/backport_action: why in the config yml do we have to checkout the whole repo, instead of targeting only the backport code itself?
