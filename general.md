@kevin: what is the 'prerelease' metadate for? When have we used it in the past, how are we using it now?
@self: what is the product 'grafana-pro'? How does it differ from 'grafana-entreprise'?
@kevin: in the grafana-delivery docs, it states 'Automatically opening a pull request to Grafana when the embargo period for a patch is lifted, and removing the patch from this repository when it's no longer applicable.' but currently this patch removal isn't automated, is it?
