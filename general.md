@kevin: what is the 'prerelease' metadate for? When have we used it in the past, how are we using it now?
@self: what is the product 'grafana-pro'? How does it differ from 'grafana-entreprise'?
@kevin/backport_action/backport.yml: why in the config yml do we have to checkout the whole repo, instead of targeting only the backport code itself?
@self: when should I use or not use a pointer in GO?
@kevin/@self: what's the difference between tagging with TAG and DRONE_TAG?
@self: are the uses of interfaces in GO only for testing? or do they have other uses? is there a JS/TS equivalent?
@kevin: how does the actual build process run? i mean, i know grafana-build has all our build tooling; but does grafana have a docker/makefile that downloads the build tools and then uses them to build the various binaries?
