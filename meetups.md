    - Imagine a friged, Colorado morning; vivid white snowfall blankets the ground and hangs heavily off tree branches, drooping usually-strong branches dangerously low to the frozen ground. The sun isn't quite up, but is already reluctantly peeking above the horizon. Jev Forsberg, me, is in his 3rd week at Grafana. He's been handed some smaller, but still important tasks, and has been fitting in well with his team. For the most part, everything has gone incredibly smoothly.

    - Suddently, a ping on Slack. Someone named Torkel Ã–degaard drops a message into our team's Slack: "It seems like the latest Grafana update introduced a bug that's breaking our Table visualization, and it's affecting a handful of our largest clients. They can access their dashboards, but they all error out. We need to fix this ASAP."
    - Who is this?!?!?
      - Oh no... - torket_odergaard_image
    - Our team springs into action. On the call, there's Victor from Romania, Oscar from Sweden, and Zoltan from Hungary, each contributing their unique perspectives:
      - Victor: his reputation for thorough analysis and meticulous problem-solving.
      - Oscar: his calm demeanor and exceptional understand of the codebase.
      - Zoltan: his ability to think outside the box and come up with creative solutions.
    - Firstly, how was this bug introduced, and when?
      - Oh no... - jev_forsberg_github_image
